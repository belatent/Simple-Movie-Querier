1.For source code, I started by modified Assignment 2's code, and I did not change the project name.

2.For EXE file, you need put movieRecord.xml and watchlist.xml with it, the program need to read this two file.

3.movieRecord.xml is the xml file posted at D2L, watchlist.xml is the database for watch list.

4.To show the graph for the search result, do the seach first(either normal search and advance search) then click 'show in graph' button. You need choose attribute for axises.The graph only show the distribution.

5.You can add comment for each movie, each comment will be store as a node in movieRecord.xml. To clean the comment, you need to open data manager at front page and choose the movie then click the "clean comment" button.

6.In the pages which have list, you can open the detail page for a movie by click any record. To switch off this 'show detail page' function, you can click check box 'Detail Page' in data manager and watch list.

7.In these case you need refresh the list to see the modify you made by the click upright button with a circle picture:
	In data manager:
	a) After new a record.
	b) After edit a recode.
	* delete and clean comment will refresh the list automaticly for you. 
	
	When you modify the record in other page, if you want to check the modify you did, you need to 	refresh the list.

8.The share and buy buttons in the detail page are fake.

9.Advance search can support muti-options and range search, some of the options can support muti-value search, read notes at advance search page. Normal search can only search for one value.
